As I wrote in the [last post](https://tonitypes.com/TODO) I work my next yearly goals in the end of each year.
This year I wanted to focus away from specific goals to a more general, idealistic, version of myself in certain areas.
What I didn't write, tho, was that I also like catchy, motivating phrases.
I like them a lot.
So much that I try to give some of my goals certain headlines.
I will spare you most of them but the headline of my overall year 2025 will be "Overwhelming positivity".

The inspiration on this one came from the review section of games on the [Steam](https://steampowered.com) game client.
It marks the top voted games where over 95 percent of the 500+ reviews have been positive.
Games in this category are not only classics like Skyrim or GTA but moreso niche games that have revolutionized genres and attracted thousands upon thousands of gamers.
I think of titles like "Subnautica", "Baldurs Gate", "Stardew Valley" or "Balatro".
What these have in common was their willingness to risk something by fully investing in a mechanic or setting that has never been done before.
Subnautica I have played and I will never forget my body sweating because of my Thalassophibia (the fear of deep bodies of water), while I dive just one metre deeper.
The others are are on my wishlist and I plan to play them when the kids give me some more freetime.
In general these games set themselves apart by going the extra mile, doing the last polish on the already cleaned car, working overtime on a project just because you believe in it.

That's how I want my positivity and hope to be, this year 2025.
Not just sitting in the burning house, drinking tee and manifesting "This is fine" to myself (as done in the popular [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine)).
Well, this is as unclear as it was written by a generic LLM, so to put it behind numbers (everything looks more professional with numbers before)

## Why being positive is worth it

1. Positivity makes me happy. I realized that spending time with people that are excited is so much more meaningful than having to endure others that bathe in negativity. The person I spend the most time with is myself. I want myself to be the very best uplifter for myself that I can be.
2. Having hope for the future enables me to move towards it. Suddenly there is a goal, something bright, not just darknes ahead. I want to see that more. So I do good things now and feel better because I move towards this more positivity that awaits my future.
3. Everything will be good. It's that childish naivity that is the single most important point in this post. Deep down in my hard I believe that everything will be good. It may be the last relict of my religious past that surived every deconstruction of christianity in my life. It will be good, because god is good. And if it is not good already, it simply is not the end yet.
