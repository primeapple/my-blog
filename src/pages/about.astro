		<p>Hi, my name is Toni.</p>
		<p>
			Ths blog is a place for myself to write thoughts, opinions and and open questions out of my
			head into a collection of letters. While I hope it may be helpful for others, it's very first
			purpose is to practice the art of writing and not sharing knowledge (which hopefully still
			happens).<br />
			To understand my point of view, it is helpful to know the following facts about me (ordered by
			importance descending for this blog)
		</p>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc" role="list">
			<li>
				I love the physical process of typing on a keyboard. One of my goals is to get very fast and
				thorough at it.
			</li>
			<li>
				I work as a programmer by day and play as a programmer by night. I enjoy rich type systems,
				allthough I sometimes get lost in "type masturbastion".
			</li>
			<li>
				I enjoy the UNIX philosophy of "Do one thing and do it well". I try to avoid devices and
				services that solve to many problems at once (Smartphones and modern IDEs are the most
				obvious ones for me).
			</li>
			<li>
				I do like all sorts of sport. The one I had most fun with is running. Sadly because of
				injuries I don't do it as much anymore.
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm a husband and father of two girls. We live on a farm in a small village in Saxony,
				Germany.
			</li>
			<li>
				I used to be very religious. Nowadays I still believe in the biblical god but my daily life
				is mostly unaffected by it. It is more of a deep knowledge that god is in control of my life
				and takes care of me.
			</li>
		</ul>

			On the technical site, this blog is a collection of templates and posts written in markdown,
			in combination with the following technologies:
